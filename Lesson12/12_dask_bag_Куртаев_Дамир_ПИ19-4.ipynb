Seemed like 8 ounces was a bit much for such a small volume of soup. The soup thickened up beautifully. Creamy and thick without being overly rich. For those who complain that this has no flavor, I am baffled. My first guess is lack of salt. The soup does require a good bit of salt and pepper, but that's the nature of any recipe. You salt as you go, and add as much as you think it needs to bring out the flavor. My second guess is using a bland supermarket cheese. I used a good quality cheddar from Trader Joe's.
